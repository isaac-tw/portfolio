        Food security will become a challenge in the future. It is important to
        forecast crop yield and related risks. DeepSense is a new system
        developed for farmers to estimate crop yield by collecting data from all
        fields. Collected data is used to predict the yield and let farmers
        manage their farms more efficiently and sustainably.
