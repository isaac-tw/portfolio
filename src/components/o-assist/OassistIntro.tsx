        Olfaction is one of the most primitive senses in organisms. It allows us
        to distinguish a rotten egg from fresh ones and notices something is
        burning in a distance. About 3% of our genes dedicated to olfaction,
        which is second only to the ones for the immune system. These facts show
        how important our sense of smell is. However, what really makes
        olfaction so different from other senses is the connection between the
        olfactory bulb and the amygdala. It allows olfactory stimuli to trigger
        emotions and memories directly and be possible for the treatment of
        psychological problems.

        In the UK, two-thirds of adults have suffered mental health problems.
        Mental illness can not only debilitate people’s physical health but also
        cause tremendous economic loss. Recently, more and more research has
        shown that people who constantly use a computer can develop stress,
        depression and other mental disorders. However, nowadays, many British
        people spend more than 6 hours per day on their computers.

        What if computers could predict users’ upcoming emotions, then benefit
        users through olfactory ways?
        <br />
        <br />
        o-assist is a personal olfactory assistant and mood improver designed
        for computer users. Based on experiments, I found that some events on
        computers usually result in negative moods and the way people use
        computers reveals their upcoming emotions. In addition, research has
        proven that some scents are helpful to improve people’s negative
        emotions So o-assist analyses users’ behaviour base on the data
        collected from users’ different applications and the I/O devices. After
        the data is fed in, o-assist runs its algorithm and forecasts users’
        moods, then releases specific smells to improve them at particular
        moments.
        <br />
        <br />
        For instance, many different emotions can be easily aroused when people
        get various notifications on computers like emails and chat messages.
        According to some keywords in these, o-assist forecast what kinds of
        emotions that the users are going to experience, then release
        corresponding scents to improve these experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        Data from the I/O devices allow o-assist to provide a better experience.
        For example, teleconferencing usually makes people nervous. By the
        signal from the user’s microphone, o-assist detects when the user talks
        in a meeting, then giving off a kind of lavender smell to calm the
        user’s nerves at a specified time.
        <br />
        <br />
        The ability of forecasting makes o-assist so unique compared to other
        olfactory products in the market. It also reveals the potential that
        machines might actively take care of human mental health in the future.
